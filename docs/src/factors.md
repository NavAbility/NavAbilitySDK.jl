# [Working with Factors](@id work_w_factors)

Factors represent the interaction between particular variables. Factors define the algebra structure between variables via probabilistic measurement models as captured measurement or data cues.  For example, a distance travelled measurement between two pose variables. Relative factors between variables are probabilistic models that capture the likelihood interactions between variables. Priors factors (i.e. unary to one variable) represent absolute information to be introduced about that variable, for example a GPS measurement; more on how to introduce distrust of such priors later.
